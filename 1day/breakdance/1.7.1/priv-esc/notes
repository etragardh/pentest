### plugin/data/tree.php

this comment was added:
/*
    even without breakdance access, post authors (contributor+) could manually write
    a tree to the breakdance_data custom field. breakdance should only run that tree
    if the post author has 'edit' permission in breakdance
    */
    // $authorId = (int) get_post_field('post_author', $post_id);
    // if (!$authorId || !\Breakdance\Permissions\hasMinimumPermission('edit', $authorId)) {
    //     return false;
    // }


### function get_tree($post_id)

From tree.php this function is returning the tree from database.
It is a json object, probably containing the entire "tree" (breakdance settings) to render a page.

This can contain PHP Code.

### added _ prefix to all custom data fields

I think this is hiding the field in WP ui.

### Breakdance is using EDD
They had vulnerable code for XSS in their samples.
Maybe breakdance is vulnerable then


### IDEA

Send request to /wp-json to create a new post
Add post_meta breakdance_data (copy tree from original)
View page to execute PHP code
