[+] {"data":{"html":"<div id=\"brxe-ahavrd\" data-script-id=\"ahavrd\" class=\"brxe-code\">Admin Created Successfully<\/div>"}} 


This data comes back when code element is rendered.
One could render other elements, since code element has strict checking
However bricks does not validate the ID to be a real ID. It will just grab what ever is sent to the render element endpoint and output it on the screen.

could possibly insert javascript there to run as administrator.
