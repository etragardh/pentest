## admin/class-north-commerce-settings.php

upload_company_logo()
 !- this is hard to do completely unauthenticated
 !- but should be possible from anyone with "edit_posts" caps.
 !- since they can reach the ordinary settings page.

 - is uploading the company logo without permission check
 - is no longer present in the UI, but backend is there
  - UI is using WP regular upload function
  - IDEA: forge this request

  - we need to access: admin/templates/settings/settings_general.php
  - it is loaded by: admin/templates/tabs/settings.php
    - can be used with _GET[''] to load settings_general as template
    - uses $this ?

    - what is loading the settings tab?

      - admin/class-north-commerce-admin.php maybe in this?
        - needs class: North_Commerce_Admin_Base
        - where is it?
        - cannot be direct access
        - can i load a settings tab?
      - or in this: public/templates/my-account.php

upload_cart_icon_svg()
  - no permission check
  - seems accessible from ajax/rest
  - checks for nonce, ajax nonce is available at index
    !- wp_ajax must have no_priv to be accessible without privs
  - CURL command in ul_svg.curl
    - uploaded file in: admin/templates/settings/cart-icons/upload/file.svg
    - file should be auto included in the DOM

upload_company_logo_image()
  - no permission check
  - nonce check with check_ajax_referer()
  - seems accessible from ajax/rest
    !- wp_ajax must have no_priv to be accessible without privs


## admin/templates/settings/settings_general.php
  - if _FILES['company-logo-image'] is set -> calls::upload_company_logo()
  - no check for direct access, but $settings = new Settings() might destroy

## public/js/north-commerce-my-account.js
54:              this.tabsManager.tabs.includes(params.get('tab')) ||
can this be used to have XSS?
