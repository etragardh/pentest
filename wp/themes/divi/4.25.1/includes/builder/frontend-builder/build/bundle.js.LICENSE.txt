/**
 * This component allows you to use dynamically registered components inside of render
 * methods--including components external to this React application. Instead of explicitly
 * rendering a component, like `<SomeComponent>`, you can use `ETBuilderInjectedComponent`:
 *
 * ```jsx
 * <ETBuilderInjectedComponent matching={slug: 'some_component'} />
 * ```.
 *
 * `ETBuilderInjectedComponent` will look up the component registered with that slug in the
 * {@link ETBuilderComponentRegistry} and render it, while passing along the props you provided.
 *
 * If no matching component is found, the `ETBuilderInjectedComponent` renders an empty `<div>`.
 *
 * `ETBuilderInjectedComponent` monitors the Component Registry for changes. If a new component
 * is registered that matches the descriptor you provided, `ETBuilderInjectedComponent` will refresh.
 *
 * @property {object}    props            Contains the props that were defined by the caller of this component.
 * @property {object}    props.matching   Set of descriptors for retrieving the component to be displayed from
 *                                    {@link ETBuilderComponentRegistry.findComponentBySlug}.
 * @property {Component} [props.fallback] An optional fallback component in case there are no matching
 *                                    components in the Component Registry.
 * @property {string[]}  [props.methods]  A list of methods that should be implemented by the registered
 *                                    component instance. If these are not implemented, the component
 *                                    won't be rendered.
