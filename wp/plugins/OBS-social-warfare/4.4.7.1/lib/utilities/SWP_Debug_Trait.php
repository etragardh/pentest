/**
 * SWP_Debug_Trait
 *
 * The purpose of this trait is to allow access to commonly used methods
 * throughout the various classes of the plugin without always having to
 * include the SWP_Abstract class as a parent class.
 *
 * The SWP_Abstract class was primary designed to support the classes
 * used to create the options page. As such, using it as a parent class for
 * something like, say, SWP_Social_Network seemed out of order as the social
 * network objects would now have all of the properties that were used on the
 * options objects.
 *
 * This means that the object would not be structured the way that I would
 * prefer. As such, I think we should rename it to SWP_Options_Abstract and
 * move it into the options folder and only use it for a parent class in
 * the options classes. We can then migrate all methods that we want to use
 * everywhere else into this trait.

	 *
	 * "SWP_Pro_Bitly->shorten_link() exited while checking for "access_token" in
	 * \wp-content\plugins\social-warfare-pro\lib\url-management\SWP_Pro_Bitly.php
	 * on line 179"
	 *
	 * IMPORTANT: This should be implemented every single time a method contains
	 * a bail conditional. This will make debugging much, much easier.
	 *
	 * We subtract 1 from the line number, so if we always place this on the very
	 * next line immediately following the bail conditional then it will return
	 * the line number of the conditional itself.
