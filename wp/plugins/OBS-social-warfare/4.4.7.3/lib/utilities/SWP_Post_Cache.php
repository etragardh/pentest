/**
 * The Post_Cache Object
 *
 * This class will control the cached data for each individual post across a
 * WordPress website. Direct calls for data such as share counts, will pull and
 * return cached data.
 *
 * Since all Post_Cache objects should be loaded via the Post_Cache_Loader class,
 * we will use the instantiation method (__construct) to queue up asyncronous
 * methods for rebuilding cached data. This should allow us to run that subset
 * of functions only once per page load, and then the cache will once again be
 * fresh for a few hours before we need to do it again.
 *
 * This class contains four major sections of methods:
 *     1. Set up the cache object and necessary properties.
 *     2. Check if the cache is fresh or not.
 *     3. Update the cached data when the cache is expired.
 *     4. Allow a publicly accessable method for fetching cached counts.
